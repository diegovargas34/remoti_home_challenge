# Home Challenge - Automation


* For the automation testing part of the challenge, RestAssured was used to perform different tests on the Pet store API: the creation, retrieval and deletion of a pet was automated using Java, RestAssured, TestNG and Maven, testing both happy paths and erroneous requests. To send the body for the create new pet request, a JSON file was added ('add_pet.json'). This file needs to be modified with the new ID of the new pet in order to execute the creation of the new pet.


To run the tests, just click on the green play button beside each of the tests using Visual Studio Code.
